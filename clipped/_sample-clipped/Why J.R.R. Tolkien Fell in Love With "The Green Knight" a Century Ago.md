#### Quotes

##### [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] on Medieval Literature
> Behind our poem stalk the figures of elder myth, and through the lines are heard the echoes of ancient cults, beliefs and symbols remote from the consciousness of an educated moralist (but also a poet) of the late fourteenth century.

##### [[Verlyn Flieger]] on the Poem's Appeal
> It's funny, it's bawdy, it's got lots of sex, it's both fantastic and realistic — real forests with imaginary beasts and real castles with mythological inhabitants.
