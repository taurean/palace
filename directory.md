# The Directory

This is an exhaustive list of every note type in [[Palace]] along with a link to that type's template, directory, and demo note. In addition to these full note types (called [[#Note kinds]]), there are also [[#Alt groupings]] and [[#Generics & Partials|Partials]].

## Note kinds

### Albums
[[Album|Template]] • [[What Now|Demo]] • [[Albums|Collection]]
Document complete musical works as unified artistic statements. Track listening experiences, note standout tracks, and organize music discovery by full album rather than individual songs.

### Articles
[[Article|Template]] • [[Why J.R.R. Tolkien Fell in Love With "The Green Knight" a Century Ago|Demo]] • [[Articles|Collection]]

### Cities
[[City|Template]] • [[Oakland|Demo]] • [[Cities|Collection]]
For tracking cities/towns and where they are located. By default, cities also include a list of places that are tagged inside of that city.

### Comic Issues
[[Comic Issue|Template]] • [[We're Taking Everyone Down with Us (No 1)|Demo]] • [[Comic Issues|Collection]]
For tracking individual comic book issues, usually from a series. Record the creators, mark if you have finished it yet, and track what you like or not like.

### Comic Series
[[system/templates/Comic Series|Template]] • [[We're Taking Everyone Down WIth Us|Demo]] • [[collections/Comic Series|Collection]]

### Course Lessons
[[Course Lesson|Template]] • [[Javascript Fundamentals|Demo]] • [[Course Lessons|Collection]]
For tracking individual lessons from courses. Track the instructors teaching, topics, and if a lesson has been finished yet.

### Courses
[[Course Lesson|Template]] • [[Intro to Javascript|Demo]] • [[Courses|Collection]]

## Alt groupings
*alt groupings are variations of other note kinds, expanding on them with more information*
### Example

Description

## Generics & Partials
Some notes don't fall under any of the previous Kinds, but there still might be some useful props to add or templated info to include. Palace comes with templates for that too.

### Basic Note
[[Basic Note|Template]] • [[Grocery List W27|Demo]]
The simplest type of a note. You can use this when you are not sure what kind to use or when you know that this note wont ever fall under the other kinds. You can easily another "Kind" template afterwards, Obsidian will merge properties together (Don't add more than one kind though).
