# The Directory

This is an exhaustive list of every note type in [[Palace]] along with a link to that type's template, directory, and demo note. In addition to these full note types (called [[#Entities]]), there are also [[#Alt groupings]] and [[#Partials]].

## Note kinds

### Albums
[[Album|Template]] • [[What Now|Demo]] • [[Albums Collection|Collection]]
Document complete musical works as unified artistic statements. Track listening experiences, note standout tracks, and organize music discovery by full album rather than individual songs.

### Articles
[[Article|Template]] • [[Why J.R.R. Tolkien Fell in Love With "The Green Knight" a Century Ago|Demo]] • [[Articles Collection|Collection]]
For capturing notes on written content across digital and print media, including periodicals, websites, magazines, newspapers, blogs, and essays. Use this template for documenting insights and reflections on any published long-form written work.

### Books
[[Book|Template]] • [[The Alchemist|Demo]] • [[Books Collection|Collection]]
For capturing comprehensive notes on literary works, including novels, short stories, novellas, anthologies, and other book-length or collected written narratives across fiction and non-fiction genres.

### Cities
[[City|Template]] • Demo • [[Cities Collection|Collection]]
For tracking cities/towns and where they are located. By default, cities also include a list of places that are tagged inside of that city.


## Alt groupings

Description

## Generics & Partials
Some notes don't fall under any of the previous Kinds, but there still might be some useful props to add or templated info to include. Palace comes with templates for that too.

### Basic Note
[[Basic Note|Template]] • [[Grocery List W27|Demo]]
The simplest type of a note. You can use this when you are not sure what kind to use or when you know that this note wont ever fall under the other kinds. You can easily another "Kind" template afterwards, Obsidian will merge properties together (Don't add more than one kind though).
