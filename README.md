**Palace** is a starter vault for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md). This file is mainly just to give the [Github Repo](https://github.com/taurean/palace) context and can be deleted. For more information, check out [Palace.md](/curtain/Palace.md). At it's core, Palace is an opinionated approach to organizing and using Obsidian with some files and configurations to make it a bit easier.
