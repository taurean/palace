# Types
Notes in Palace usually have some combination of properties. Properties are largely used for querying and displaying data in [Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases) and dataview queries. Below are what they are, what they mean, and the [kind of data](https://help.obsidian.md/properties#Property+types) you add to them.

## `aliases`
_type: **aliases**_
`aliases` is used for giving a note an alternative name. for example, one common use case is a note being named `Firstname Lastname.md`, setting an aliases called `Firstname` would also let you tag that note, including with auto complete. the end result would look like this `[[Firstname Lastname|Firstname]]`. 

## `contains`
_type: **multitext**_
`contains` is used to add tags indicating that this note includes something you might consider special. For example, when you use the template for adding a map to a note, it also adds the `contains` property with `"map"` stored inside. That lets you quickly search and see what notes have maps in them.

## `cover`
_type: **text**_
When publishing via Obsidian Publish, you can use the `cover` property to provide a path that is used when previewing the link (eg. on social media or in messaging apps). The image path that you provide must lead to an image that is also published.

## `creator`
_type: **multitext**_
`creator` is used for listing the person, organization, or people for actively creating that piece of media.

## `cssclasses`
_type: **multitext**_
this property takes each item you give it and adds that text as the name of CSS classes on the element wrapping your content. If you are somewhat comfortable with CSS, you can use this to style specific notes with unique class names and styles.

## `description`
_type: **text**_
`description` is used when publishing a note via Obsidian Publish. With this property, you are able to update the description that is displayed in search results and when viewing the preview of the page while sharing to social media or messaging apps.

## `finished`
_type: **checkbox**_
the `finished` property is used to indicate if *you* have finished reading/watching/consuming this specific media. It's a handy way to include notes to things you want to remember or write about while also creating a queue of stuff you are interested in checking out.

## `genre`
_type: **multitext**_
`genre` is used to for organizing media. This is specifically used for music, television, and literature.

## `kind`
_type: **text**_
`kind` is the property that is used to identify the different kinds of notes built into Palace. A note can only have one entity. The prop also should be a backlink to the collection for that type, for example `[[Albums Collection|Albums]]`.

## `liked`
_type: **checkbox**_
sometimes you watch something you know is bad but you still really enjoyed it. Sometimes its something that you recognize as great but its just not for you. The `liked` property lets you capture that nuance, separating `rating` from what you enjoy.

## `location`
_type: **multitext**_
the `location` property is specifically required for the [Leaflet](https://github.com/javalent/obsidian-leaflet) plugin. By adding the latitude and longitude in the `location` prop, you can add pins in maps for that place's exact location. 

## `permalink`
_type: **text**_
the `permalink` property is used if you want to alter the slug of a note when using Obsidian Publish. You might have a note titled **How I use AI** for example but make the URL `yoursite.com/ai` by setting `permalink` to `ai`.

## `publish`
_type: **checkbox**_
by default, the Obsidian Publish plugin is configured to not publish any notes unless you publish them in the plugin's modal dialog. If you include `publish: true`, that note will be automatically selected for publishing the next time you open that dialog.

## `rating`
_type: **number**_
the `rating` property is for you evaluating content, primarily media. The scale is always whole numbers between 1 and 5. 

## `release-date`
_type: **date**_
the `release-date` property is used to indicate the official date that media was released. 

## `tags`
_type: **tags**_
the `tags` property is one that comes by default with obsidian and so I have opted to not remove it. You can use this property to keep a list of tags for included topics.

## `unlisted`
_type: **checkbox**_
This property is used to omit a published note from showing up in lists generated by dataview or eventually Bases. The notes are still publicly available and searchable but they wont be _as visible_ as before.
