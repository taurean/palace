# Road to Palace 1.0
Currently, I have not found a way to neatly support updating your own personal vault to future releases of Palace. For this reason, I am designing palace to always be a starting point that you diverge from. As of right now, the plan is to get Palace to a 1.0 state and then archive the repo. Below are the various components that are still missing.

## Docs
- [ ] Hotkeys
- [ ] Organizing Entities
- [ ] Home
- [ ] Publish Home
- [ ] Template vs Templater Templates
- [ ] Plugins + configs
- [ ] Quests
- [ ] Clipping
- [ ] "Almanac"
- [ ] Creating your own entities and entity alts (Celebrity would be a sibling of Person, not a subset of person. Its just the person template with more information. they are there to help save time, not add more complex structure)

## Entities
for each entity, the following is needed:
- Collection
- Base
- Template
- Sample
- Description in [[directory]]
