Do not add the ### Quotes heading or any related content. Return nothing for this section. All formatting must use proper markdown syntax. The output should follow this exact markdown pattern: Start with ### Quotes then for each quote use #### [Person] on [Topic] followed by > [quote text]. the person should be wrapped in double brackets `[[like this]]`. if the quoted person is the author of the article, commit the attribution and just set the heading as the topic. do not add an attribution below the quote.\"}}\n\n---\n\n***originally published by [[{{site}}]] on [[{{published|date:\"YYYY-MM-DD\"}}|{{published|date:\"MMMM D, YYYY\"}}]]***\n\n---\n## My notes:\n%% Enter notes below this line %%\n\n",
