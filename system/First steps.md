# First steps

a checklist of things to try out to make the most out of Palace. As you try to form a habit of using obsidian more often, try to spread out this check list over a week or two. Reach for it when you don't already have an idea of what you might add.

## beginner stuff
- [ ] Create a year note with your goals or intentions for the year
- [ ] Create a daily note and write about setting up Palace
- [ ] Create a quarter note for this quarter with a few things you want to focus on

- [ ] Add a note for the last book you read
- [ ] Create notes for five different people:
	- [ ] a family member
	- [ ] a friend
	- [ ] a colleague
	- [ ] a public figure

## intermediate stuff
- [ ] Set up the web clipper
