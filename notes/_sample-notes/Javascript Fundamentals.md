## What is JS?

- makes websites interactive
- runs in browser
- different from Java!! (confusing name)

## Getting started

- right click → inspect → console tab
- can type code directly here
- `console.log("hello")` - prints stuff

## Variables

store information for later

```js
let name = "alex";
let age = 25;
console.log(name);
```

- `let` = can change later
- `const` = stays same
- strings need quotes, numbers don't

## tried:

```js
let city = "seattle";
let temp = 72;
console.log("It's " + temp + " in " + city);
```

worked! prints: It's 72 in seattle
